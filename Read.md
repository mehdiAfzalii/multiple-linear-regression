# Linear Regression Model for Advertising Sales Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that implements a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending.

## Dataset

The model utilizes a dataset containing advertising spending across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and their corresponding sales figures.

## Model Implementation

The code performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads the advertising dataset.
2. **Data Splitting:** Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training:** Trains a linear regression model on the training data.
4. **Prediction:** Predicts sales on the test data.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance by comparing predicted sales with actual sales.
6. **Visualization:** Visualizes the predicted sales against actual sales.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

To run the code:

1. Ensure all the necessary dependencies are installed.
2. Replace 'advertising.csv' with the actual filename if it differs.
3. Run the Python script.

## Results

The model demonstrates a reasonable accuracy in predicting sales based on advertising spending. The visualization provides a clear comparison between predicted and actual sales.
